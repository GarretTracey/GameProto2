    <h2> The Story: </h2>
<p><b> Director Grizzly: </b> Agent X isn’t the only person to exist in more
    than one world. There is another, a malevolent entity we know
    as Crucius, who moves across the multiverse like a blight.
    Where Agent X has learned to ride the waves of dimensional
    energy, Crucius is Typhoon and Tyrant both, causing chaos
    across worlds and using that chaos for their own cruel ends.
    Agent X had fought them before, but this time, Crucius was
    ready, pulling Agent X into their trap to remove them as
    opposition once and for all.</p>

    <h2> Make some Noise! </h2>
<p> Remember, your beta object is: <p id = betaStart></p></p>

<p>Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to a) turn off their camera, and b) manipulate their
  Object Beta to make an audible sound. They should repeat this for a total of 10 seconds.
  The other Players then have 60 seconds to individually decide two possibilities about the object
  based on this sound: <ol>
  <li> A verb (ending in “-ing”) that describes how the sound was made </li>
 <li>What fantastic contraption or object might make that sound in their universe.</li>
  Record each players decisions here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First Player- Verb (ending in 'ing'): <input id="verbS1" placeholder = "input answer"> and Contraption:<input id="contraptionS1" placeholder = "input here"></li>
    <li>Second Player- Verb (ending in 'ing'): <input id="verbS2" placeholder = "input answer"> and Contraption:<input id="contraptionS2" placeholder = "input here"></li>
    <li>Third Player- Verb (ending in 'ing'): <input id="verbS3" placeholder = "input answer"> and Contraption:<input id="contraptionS3" placeholder = "input here"></li>
</ul>

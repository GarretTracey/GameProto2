        Crucius’s machines surrounded Agent X, whirring and humming with power
        and energy. Crucius laughed, enjoying their victory. “At long last,
        Agent X, we meet face to face,” they said, pacing around the perimeter
        of their hellish machine. “You’ve foiled me time and again, turned my
        glorious schemes to rubble. But now you’ve failed, my old friend.” Agent
        X looked around, seeking any way out. “A little premature, don’t you
        think?” Agent X replied. “We both know I’ve escaped worse.” Crucius
        smiled. “Not this time, I’m afraid. This is all for you; there’s no
        grander plan, no worlds to conquer, just a thorn to remove from my side.
        There is no escape”

      <p> Remember, your Gamma Object is <p id ="gammaStart"></p></p>
      <p> Read the following Directions aloud, and make sure everyone understands them.
        Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to describe a memory they have that surrounds
        their Object Gamma—without describing the object itself. The describing Player has 60
        seconds to recount their memory.
        The other Players then have 60 seconds to individually decide two possibilities about the object
        based on this memory: <ol>
        <li>An emotion that comes to mind when hearing the memory recounted—how did the story
        make you feel?</li>
        <li>What fantastic contraption or object that might reproduce that same emotion in their </li>
        Agent's universe.Record each players guess of a feeling and contraption here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Player- Verb: <input id="feeling1" placeholder = "input answer"> and Contraption:<input id="contraptionM1" placeholder = "input here"></li>

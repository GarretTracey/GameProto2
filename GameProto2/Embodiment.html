<h1> Part One: Embodiment</h1>
<div>
<h2> Story:</h2>
<p> <b>Doctor Polybius: </b> Agent X is not like most of our agents.
They are aware of their own multidimensionality, and they are
able to move between worlds. They don’t have control over
this power; they shift when dimensional tides or energies carry
them away, but they’ve learned to ride these tides like a surfer
on a wave. It’s remarkable, honestly.
Through the years, Agent X has gained a reputation as an
unorthodox investigator. In our dimension they may be
following some seemingly mundane and unconnected
task—eating from a bowl that isn’t there, straining to hear
sounds no one else can, or recalling memories from a life they
never lived. Meanwhile in another reality Agent X’s counterpart
braves a hurricane to reach the ancient library that’s home to a
spell-casting robot chef!

<h2> Embody!</h2>
<p> Remember, your alpha item is:<p id="alphaStart"></p> </p>
    
 <p>Read the following directions aloud, and make sure everyone understands them.
  Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to act out a description of their Object Alpha in
  10 seconds, using only mime.</p>
  
 <p> The other Players then have 60 seconds to collectively decide three possibilities about the
  object based on this performance: <ol>
  <li> A verb that describes its use (ending in 'ing') </li>
  <li>A location it would likely be used </li>
  <li>Amount of time spent using the object </li>
  The describing player records the decisions made by the other players here:</p>
   
    <ul>
        <li> Verb (ending in 'ing'): <input id="verb" placeholder="input answer"></input></li>
        <li> Location: <input id="location" placeholder="input answer"></input></li>
        <li> Time: <input id="time" placeholder="input answer"></input></li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <p> Once all players have had the chance to act out their alpha item, click <b> generate world</b> to create your story! </p>

    <h1>Story Set-Up</h1>
    <DIV>
    <p><B>Director Grizzly: </B> Greetings, Agents. We have a priority one
      situation: We’ve lost track of Agent X. Agent X is one of our best
      agents, and if a problem is dangerous enough that they couldn’t
      handle it, it could be a threat to the entire multiverse. Because
      Agent X uniquely exists in multiple different dimensions at once,
      locating them conventionally is impossible. You have all
      assembled a series of objects that are linked to Agent X across
      worlds, which should be enough to give us some idea of what’s
      going on. Doctor Polybius will guide you through the process.
      She’s one of our foremost experts on dimensional resonance links.
</DIV>
<DIV>
     <B> Doctor Polybius: </B> What you have may seem like mundane
      objects, but they are all linked to something in another world. By
      using this connection, we can use your objects to glean information
      about what happened to Agent X. Keep your objects secret for
      now, revealing them could upset the connection.</p>
  </DIV>
<div>
  <h1> Preparation: </h1>
    <p>What makes Agent X so successful is that they aren’t just one agent, but instead are multiple
      versions of the same individual across many realities—Agent X exists in your reality too! Give
      them a name of your choosing:</p>

    <p>My Universe's Agent X's name is Agent <input id="agentName" placeholder="Insert Name Here" /></p>

    <p>The goal of the game is not to correctly guess the mundane objects that the other players
      brought, but rather to imagine what strange and mysterious objects could exist based on the
      descriptions and sounds they make.
      When other players describe an object to you, imagine the context they use them in. Which of
      the 5 senses are involved in the experience - smell, taste, touch, vision, hearing? What types of
      actions can these objects be used for, how often are they used, would you use them alone or
      with two or more people? Making analogies between these objects with other things can also be
      a very useful strategy. Remember...
      <b>What may seem mundane in your world might be magical elsewhere! </b> Complete this section before the start of the game. You will need to choose three household
      objects that you can bring to the game, and fill out this page accordingly.</p>

    <p><b>Object Alpha:</b> Pick any object that you associate with an action, place, or time of day: <input id="alpha" placeholder="input answer"></p>
    <p><b>Object Beta:</b> Choose an object that has a distinctive sound. Either it generates sound or makes a noise
      when otherwise manipulated (tapped, crinkled, dropped, etc.), or both. Pick an object that
      makes a loud enough sound to be picked up by a mic: <input id="beta" placeholder="input answer"></p>
    <p><b>Object Gamma:</b> Select any object that is attached to a specific personal memory—something where you can
      clearly recall a moment in time and the circumstances that surround it: <input id="gamma" placeholder="input answer"></p>
